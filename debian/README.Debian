There are some tweaks which were applied to the standard cfengine3 installation
and you should be aware of them:

*) cfengine3 is FHS, that means that, unlike the original, we log in /var/log,
the binaries are located in /usr/sbin; for upstream compatibility we have the
following symlink:         /usr/sbin      -> /var/lib/cfengine3/binÂ§

*) By default we are not starting any daemon. To enable the daemons you need
to modify /etc/default/cfengine3 and set the proper variables;

***** TO CONFIGURE AS A POLICY SERVER ( HUB ) *****

      - Copy a baseline policy:

	# cp /usr/share/doc/cfengine3/examples/masterfiles/* \
		/var/cfengine/masterfiles/

      - Bootstrap the system by pointing it at a non-loopback local address:

	# cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server <LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>

      - Run the agent manually:

	# cf-agent -If failsafe.cf && cf-agent -I
	R: --> I'm a policy hub.

      - Optionally enable the server, monitor and exec daemons in
	/etc/default/cfengine3 and run /etc/init.d/cfengine3 restart.

***** TO CONFIGURE AS CLIENT *****

      - bootstrap the client:

	# cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server <POLICY_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>

      - Run the agent manually:

	# cf-agent -If failsafe.cf && cf-agent -I
	R: --> <POLICY_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS> is my policy hub.
	R: --> CFE is running on <FQDN>

      - Optionally enable the server, monitor and exec daemons in
	/etc/default/cfengine3 and run /etc/init.d/cfengine3 restart.
